# Advance_Machine_Learning

## Course Description:
This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning with theoretical analysis. We will especially be interested in using mathematical models to explain why and when certain methods/models work, particularly we will pay attention to certain algorithms with convergence rate analysis. 

## Topics Covered:
* Linear Models for Regression
* Spectral Clustering
* Gradient Descent with its Variations
* Support Vector Machine
* Principal Component Analysis
* Matrix Factorization/Completion
* Kernel in PCA/Regression/SVM
* Naïve Bayes
* Linear Discriminant Analysis/Metric Learning
* Logistic Regression
* Perceptron and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
* AutoEncoder
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
* Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
* Graph Neural Network (GNN)
